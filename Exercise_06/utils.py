def get_minibatches(X, mb_size, shuffle=True):

    Generate minibatches from given dataset for training.

    Params:
    -------
    X: np.array of M x 3
        Contains the triplets from dataset. The entities and relations are
        translated to its unique indices.

    mb_size: int
        Size of each minibatch.

    shuffle: bool, default True
        Whether to shuffle the dataset before dividing it into minibatches.
